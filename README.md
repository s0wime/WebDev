I created this project to learn the basics of web development.

### I used the following technologies:

Solve 5 homework assignments, of varying levels of difficulty

1. The first homework was to implement the layout using any type of positioning.
2. The second homework assignment was to implement the layout using Float, Flexbox, CSS Grid.
3. The third homework assignment was on adapting the layout for mobile devices and email layout.
4. The fourth homework assignment was to implement a new layout using any positioning method along with adaptation for mobile devices.
